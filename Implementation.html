  <p>Planning </p>
<p>In this phase we will plan out the various things we want the software to do. This involves going to each department and making a list of everything that is needed. We then will take that list and make a model of how we believe the software will be developed. </p>
  <p>Analysis </p>
<p>In the analysis phase we will look at the different actions we want the software to do and make sure they will not interfere with other actions of the software. We want to ensure we are implementing everything we need and nothing that we don’t. </p>
  <p>Design </p>
<p>This company has a lot of turn over, and for that reason we want a simple user friendly design. The plan is to implement multiple designs to the companies employees and figure out which one is better liked. It is important for us to have multiple designs to choose from as there are a variety of people at this company. </p>
  <p>Development/ Implementation </p>
<p>At this phase we will begin developing our software. Along the way we will release versions of it to put out feelers in the company. This way the employees can follow along with us as we design and change things as needed. </p>
  <p>Testing </p>
<p>When we have our finished model, we will want to test the software within the company and get feedback regarding changes or bugs in the software. This is the time we want employees to test every part of the software to ensure it does everything that is needed. </p>
  <p>Maintenance </p>
<p>At this final phase we will do maintenance on the software every once in awhile to ensure it’s software is up to date. We will work out any bugs that come along to ensure a smooth and reliable software. </p>
  <p>Budget</p>
<p>After doing research, we budgeted $150,000 for this software. We would like 4 programmers 3 software testers and 1 project manger. The team will meet weekly to discuss any problems as well as completion of the tasks at hand. This will help ensure that everything is being done in a timely manner and everyone in the team is aware of any problems.</p>
