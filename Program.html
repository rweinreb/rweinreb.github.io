  <p>When fruit is delivered to the packing warehouse, the user will start a new purchase order to receive the fruit into inventory. This part of the program will allow the user to enter pallets and weights for each load of fruit. The user will also print pallet tags for each pallet and scan where the pallet will be located in the warehouse. </p>

  <p>After fruit is received into inventory, the receiving department will send out a report of pallets and their corresponding weights. This is sent out to the growers and the A/P department.</p>

  <p>Sales orders are made, and the operations department must make a packing list for the day. The list will have all the pallets needed, as well as cartons to pack in to. The operations department will follow the list to ensure each sales order is filled.</p>

  <p>After fruit is packaged, it needs to be shipped. The operations department will use this case to schedule shipments and make bills of ladings. This allows the department to track every 
shipment made.</p>

  <p>When fruit is delivered and accepted, it will be invoiced. The customer will have 30 days to pay, when the customer pays it we will use that money to pay the growers. If fruit is rejected at delivery, it will be taken back in to inventory and shipped to a new location.</p>

  <p>When all is said and done, the grower who brought the food must be paid. Employees will start a new payment and take any charges out of their total payment. It then will be entered into the system as paid. </p>
