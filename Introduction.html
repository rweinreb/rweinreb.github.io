<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to outline a software I will be developing. In this document I will explain the need for the software and the process of using it. Readers will understand the steps it takes to develop this software. They will follow me through the development process. Throughout this report I will explain each part of the software and how it will be used. The illustrations will give readers a better understanding of the software functions. </p>

<p>Background 
<p>I have worked for HBF International for six months. I use their software daily for up to eight hours a day. In those eight hours the software will crash multiple times. It is impossible to get any work done and slows the whole company down. The company's managers got together and wrote out the essential functions of the system. We then broke down every function and what value it brought to the company. We found that the system we are currently using has way too many functions and that is what causes a lot of confusion. After much thought, we came up with a minimal amount of functions that would get the job done and from those we would add more as needed. </p>

After coming up with each function, we analyzed what exactly we wanted to be able to do. We came up with the things we didnâ€™t like in our current system and found ways to make them more useful. Every function in the old system was examined and picked apart for its pros and cons. We then took all the pros and applied them to the new system design. In the design we came up with the different types of users: Managers, employees, owners. Each user would have different access to the system. We also listed every single function we wanted and then put them in categories and subcategories. Finally, we used the list of cons and gathered solutions to each problem. These solutions would be used in the new system to better serve each user. 

<p>Scope
<p>This application is a remake of an application the company already has. The software will take beneficial parts of the old system and remake them into a new software. Managers will be able to oversee incoming fruit and jobs, employees will be able to edit purchase orders, and owners will be able to pay growers. This will all be done efficiently and with no system crashes. </p>

<p>Report Structure 
<p>This report has an abstract that explains why I am doing this report. It has an introduction that explains the software. The standards and specifications section will explain the technical environment of the software. File/Database specifications shows how the software will be used, by who, and how. This section will have diagrams as well as explanations of the diagrams. Program specifications tells the programmers what documentation is needed to deliver the programs. Finally, the recommendations and conclusion section to sum of the introduction and explain what will happen next.</p>
