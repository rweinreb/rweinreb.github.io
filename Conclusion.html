<h1>Reccomendations and Conclusions</h1>
<p>This report outlined a software that will be developed for HBF International. We have budgeted $150,000 and expect it to take about a year and a half. 

The design will need to take priority here, as it is very important to this software. It needs to be carefully developed. It is important to the employees that the software does not crash and runs smoothly. Once the software is complete it will be crucial to continue with updates to ensure the software runs well. The employees will help give feedback when needed. 


When all is said and done, this should be an easily run software with little learning time. The user should effortlessly navigate through the program. Letâ€™s take our time and make sure the customer is satisfied with our work.
